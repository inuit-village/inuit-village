# [inuitcss Village](http://area73.github.io/inuit-village/)

This project provides a brief introduction to [inuitcss](https://github.com/inuitcss) by [Harry Roberts](https://github.com/csswizardry). 
It shows the features, objects and helpers of the framework, so that you know with what you can mess around with.

It is intented to be a repository and a documentation place for all posible inuit elements (not only the ones created by Harry Roberts)


It follows ITCSS phylosophy and best practice


## Phylosophy

### ITCSS
               
    -------------   SETTINGS    (Variable declarations)
     -----------    TOOLS       (functions, mixins, placeholders)
      ---------     GENERIC     (resets)
       -------      BASE        (tag defaults)
        -----       OBJECTS     (patterns e.g. grid systems, tiles)
         ---        COMPONENTS  (component level styling)
          -         TRUMPS      (!importants)

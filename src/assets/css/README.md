#css-scaffold
css-scaffold is a css file structure for a Sass/SCSS-based project. It's based on the [itcss methodology](http://itcss.io/) by [Harry Roberts](https://github.com/csswizardry) and is meant to be used together with [inuitcss](http://inuitcss.com/).

You can put this into your project as a [git submodule](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) and update from time to time, if you need.

###Prerequisities
- [sass-globbing](https://github.com/chriseppstein/sass-globbing)
- inuitcss' framework repositories have to be downloaded manually. [Bower](http://bower.io/) is to be favoured for managing this. [Here](https://github.com/TryGenesis/genesis/blob/master/bower.json) you'll find an example.

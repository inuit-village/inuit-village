    <div class="box box--large box--light-bg">
        <p>Inuit Village is intented to be a place to host all pices (as Harry says we can call
            them "Igloos") of InuitCSS framework that follows Inuit Standars such us ITCSS, BEM, and others described
            below in <a href="#best-practices">Best Practices</a> section.</p>
        <p>The intention of this village is to have as much a as Inuit "Igloos" that may be around as long has they are
            deliverd by bower (or npm)</p>
        <p>As I said, it is not limited only to Harry Roberts elements and any body can contribute to the Village</p>
        <p>For each component (object, generic,settings, etc) there is a documented page and in some cases there are
            also
            examples of use</p>
        <p>With this github project and also web page you can always have a good reference of Inuit framework and a
            quick gide to use it. You can download the project, fork it or just surf the web page to see what you can
            achieve
            with InuitCSS
        </p>
        <p>The project is intented to be as much as modularized as posible, in order to allow the developers to only
            grab what they need, please see "how to use it" section to get a better undestanding</p>

            <p>In <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/csswizardry">Harry Robert's</a> own words:</p>
            <p>inuit.css is a CSS framework. Another one. Except I like to think that inuit.css is a little different.
                It’s
                not a grid system, it’s not a boilerplate, it’s not a starting point, it’s a fully featured and
                extensive
                framework. It is designed to do 90% of the grunt work for you, it takes care of the boring bits that you
                have to do on every build and leaves you enough time to concentrate fully on the fun bits.</p>


            <h4 class="u-mb0">Pragmatic</h4>

            <p>inuit.css is a pragmatic framework which uses lots of progressive enhancement. Rather than trying to be
                everything to everyone it performs to its environment. IE7 works a treat, but Firefox 4 works even
                better.
                inuit.css takes a sensible approach to web development.</p>

        </div>
        <h3 class="u-mb0"><a name="itcss">ITCSS</a></h3>
        <div class="box">
            <p>In <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/csswizardry">Harry Robert's</a> own words:</p>
            <p>ITCSS—which stands for Inverted Triangle CSS—is a fully managed CSS architecture. It's not a framework or
                library;
                there's nothing to download or install.</p>

            <P>It's a collection of principles and metrics by which developers should group and order their CSS in order
                to
                keep
                it
                scalable, terse, logical, and manageable.</P>

            <p>It's very specifically opinionated in that it gives definite rules and guidelines for your source order
                and
                groupings, but it leaves decisions about naming conventions and preprocessors etc. up to you. This means
                that,
                although ideally suited to larger projects, ITCSS can be used on builds of all shapes and sizes.</p>


            <p>One of the key principles of ITCSS is that it separates your CSS codebase to several sections (called
                layers),
                which take form of the inverted triangle:</p>
            <div class="layout">
                <div class="layout__item u-1/2 u-1/1-palm layout--flush">
                    <img src="assets/img/itcss.png">
                </div>
                <div class="layout__item u-1/2 u-1/1-palm">
                    <img src="assets/img/itcss-key-metrics.svg">
                </div>
            </div>


            <p>These layers are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Settings</strong> – used with preprocessors and contain font, colors definitions, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Tools</strong> – globally used mixins and functions. It’s important not to output any CSS in
                    the
                    <strong>first 2 layers</strong>.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Generic</strong> – reset and/or normalize styles, box-sizing definition, etc. This is the
                    first
                    layer which generates actual CSS.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Base</strong> – styling for bare HTML elements (like H1, A, etc.). These come with default
                    styling
                    from the browser so we can redefine them here.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Objects</strong> – class-based selectors which define undecorated design patterns, for
                    example
                    media
                    object known from OOCSS
                </li>
                <li><strong>Components</strong> – specific UI components. This is where majority of our work takes place
                    and
                    our
                    UI components are often composed of Objects and Components
                </li>
                <li><strong>Trumps</strong> – utilities and helper classes with ability to override anything which goes
                    before
                    in the triangle, eg. hide helper class
                </li>
            </ul>


            <p>The triangle also shows how styles represented by selectors are ordered in the resulting CSS: from
                generic
                styles
                to explicit ones, from low-specificity selectors to more specific ones (but still not too specific, IDs
                are
                not
                allowed) and from far reaching to localized ones.</p>

            <p>BEM is an abbreviation of three entities: a Block, an Element and a Modifier. BEM is a methodology of web
                projects development, that allows you to divide an interface into logically independent blocks.</p>
            <p>We are using BEM to name our CSS class and consecuently named in the HTML</p>
            <h4 class="u-mb0">BLOCK</h4>
            <p>Standalone entity that is meaningful on its own.</p>
            <p>A Block will be the component itself named in lower case to delimit separate words with a hyphen (-)
                character.
            <p>
            <h4 class="u-mb0">ELEMENTS</h4>
            <p>Parts of a block and have no standalone meaning. They are semantically tied to its block.</p>
            <p>An Element will be the union of the block name and double Underscore "__" follow by a reperesentative
                name</p>
            <h4 class="u-mb0">MODIFIER</h4>
            <p>Flags on blocks or elements. Use them to change appearance or behavior.</p>
            <p>A Modifier will be the name of the block or an element folllow by doble hyphen (--) and a reperesentative
                name</p>
            <p>Here is an example of using BEM in HTML and CSS</p>

        <div class="box">

            <p>The term was introduced by <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cecil_Martin"
                                             title="Robert Cecil Martin">Robert C.
                Martin</a> in an article by the same name as part of his <i>Principles of Object Oriented Design</i>
                made
                popular by his book <i>Agile
                    Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices</i>.</p>

            <p>The single responsibility principle states that every module or class should have responsibility over a
                single part of the functionality provided by the software, and that responsibility should be entirely
                encapsulated by the class. All its services should be narrowly aligned with that responsibility.</p>
            <p>In other words this principle states that everything you create should be created for a single,
                focused reason. The styles you apply to a given selector should be created for a single purpose, and
                should
                do that single purpose extremely well.</p>
            <p>This doesn’t mean you should have individual classes for padding-10, font-size-20, and color-green. The
                single purpose we’re talking about is not the styles that they apply, but rather where the styles are
                applied</p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="u-mb0"><a name="sst">Single source of truth principe</a></h3>
        <div class="box">
            <p>The single source of truth approach takes the single responsibility theory to the next level in that not
                only is a class created for a single purpose, but also the styles applied to that class come from one
                single
                source. In a modular design, the design of any component must be determined by the component itself, and
                never imposed on it by a parent class.</p>

                reference
                before the bower component does and is meant to contain all variables that can be change in the bower/npm
                component. The second file is an override modifier that extends the component by overriding or
                extendings their initial values</p>
            <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Not all Igloos have variables to setup , there for they may not have a --setup

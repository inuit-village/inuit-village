This module provides exactly the same function as [widths](trumps.widths.html), but for specific breakpoints. It is based on the list in [responsive settings](settings.responsive.html) and creates individual widths classes for each breakpoint availale in that list.

The class names distinguish itselves from [widths](trumps.widths.html) by a breakpoint suffix such as `.u-1/3-palm`.

By default inuitcss creates classes for responsive wholes, halves, thirds, quarters and fifths. You can override the map defined in this module to add more classes.

***This module is required and must be present in every inuitcss-project.**

If you want to assign a specific font-size to an element (e.g. 36px), you would apply the mixin as follows:
```
.page-intro{
    @include inuit-font-size(36px);
}
```

This spits out the following css:
```
.page-intro{
    font-size: 36px;
    font-size: 2rem;
    line-height: 1.55556;
}
```
The pixel-based font-size declaration serves as fallback for browsers not supporting the rem unit. If the browser supports rem, it will use the rem value instead. Beyond that, the mixin generates a line-height that maintains the vertical rhythm in your project.

If you will however declare a custom line-height, you can pass it to the mixin as an argument:
```
.page-intro{
    @include inuit-font-size(36px, 1.25);
}
```

You can also prevent the mixin from generating a line-height at all:
```
.page-intro{
    @include inuit-font-size(36px, false);
}
```
which will produce:
```
.page-intro{
    font-size: 36px;
    font-size: 2rem;
}
```
